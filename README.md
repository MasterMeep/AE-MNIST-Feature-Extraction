# AE-MNIST-Feature-Extraction
Using an autoencoder with a latent dimension of 3 and pre/post latent dimensions of 128, this notebook extracts features from MNIST and scatter plots the new latent representations of the numbers in 2d and 3d. this novel generation is suboptimal as the AE was not organized for generation, but instead feature extraction

# Plotted Features
plotting each feature on a different axis generates the following plot
